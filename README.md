contrastive-inverse-regression
======


cir is a python package provided the algorithm for contrastive inverse regression (CIR) for dimension reduction used in a supervised setting to find a low-dimensional representation by solving a nonconvex optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold. 


Installation
------------
Make sure you have numpy, pandas, and scipy install beforehand and the version of these packages compatible with cir. The easy way to install is using ``pip``:

```python

pip install contrastive-inverse-regression

```

Alternatively, you can also install by cloning this repository: 

```python

pip install git+https://github.com/myueen/cir.git

```

Dependencies
------------
- Python (>= 3.10.9)
- numpy (>= 1.24.3)
- pandas (>= 2.1.4)
- scipy (>= 1.9.3)

To run exmaple, matplotlib (>= 3.8.2) is required



Example
--------
The dataset for the following example is included in the example/dataset folder. 
```python
from contrastive_inverse_regression import CIR
import pandas as pd

d = 2
alpha = 0.0001

# download the dataset and set it to the absolute path in your computer 
fg = pd.read_csv('../foregroundX.csv')
bg = pd.read_csv('../backgroundX.csv')
Y = pd.read_csv('../foregroundY.csv')
Yt = pd.read_csv('../backgroundY.csv')

fg = fg.iloc[0:, 1:]
bg = bg.iloc[0:, 1:]
Y = Y.iloc[0:, 1:]
Yt = Yt.iloc[0:, 1:]

V = CIR(fg, Y, bg, Yt, alpha, d)

```
Other detailed examples for employing cir are provided. 

For the case of discrete foreground Y values, the mouse protein dataset  Data_Cortex_Nuclear.csv is used and the corresponding visualization in mp_regression.py and regression testing in mp_regression.py.

For the case of continuous foreground Y values, cir is applied on the retinol dataset Retinol.txt and the corresponding regression is in plasma_regression.py. Continuous values are not usually for classification, hence visualization is not provided.
